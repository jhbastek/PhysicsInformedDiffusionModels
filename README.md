## Introduction & Setup
We introduce a framework to inform diffusion models of constraints generated samples must adhere to during model training, as presented in [Physics-Informed Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14404).
To conduct similar studies as those presented in the preprint, start by cloning this repository via
```
git clone https://github.com/jhbastek/PhysicsInformedDiffusionModels.git
```
We provide three scripts:

`main_toy.py` reproduces the toy study presented in Appendix F.1. It is helpful to understand the implications of the PIDM loss and several variants. Simply change the config file and run the script to reproduce the results or experiment with different parameters.

To reproduce the results for the Darcy flow and topology optimization study, you will first have to download the data and pretrained models from the [ETHZ Research Collection](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000674074) and place them (unzipped) as follows:
```
.
├── data
│   ├── darcy
│   │   └── ...
│   └── mechanics
│       └── ...
└── trained_models
    ├── darcy
    │   └── ...
    └── mechanics
        └── ...
```

After this, you can run the following scripts:

`main.py` reproduces the Darcy flow and topology optimization study presented in Section 4. Simply adjust the parameters and governing equations in `model.yaml` and run the script to train the models. Note that the name of the run and logging parameters can be directly adjusted in `main.py`, if necessary.

`sample.py` evaluates trained models. Provide the `directory_path`, `name`, and `load_model_step` of the model to evaluate and run the script. Note that the full evaluation of the in- and out-of-distribution test sets for the topology optimization study may take some time.
